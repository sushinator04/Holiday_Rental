### Project Description

The project is a responsive, user-friendly website for renting a holiday house. For simplicity we will feature one of our own holiday houses located in Sent/Scuol. It will feature an interactive booking calendar, a photo gallery with lightbox effects, and a dynamic cost calculator with seasonal pricing adjustments. To enhance usability, it will include a review section, a detailed FAQ with collapsible sections, and a contact form with real-time validation. An interactive map will showcase nearby attractions, providing users with a comprehensive booking experience. The project aims to demonstrate our skills in HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and responsive design while creating an accessible, functional, and engaging user experience.
