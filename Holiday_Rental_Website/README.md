## Project Description
*Chasellas 62* is a tailored rental website designed to address the unique challenges faced by vacation homeowners, particularly in the Lower Engadin region of Switzerland. Unlike mainstream platforms such as Airbnb, it prioritizes personalized interactions between homeowners and guests, streamlines the booking process, and provides tools to establish a distinctive brand identity. Developed with a robust tech stack featuring React for the frontend and Flask for the backend, the platform ensures a seamless user experience while adhering to modern web standards, including accessibility and mobile-first design. By catering to the specific needs of homeowners and enhancing guest satisfaction, *Chasellas 62* represents a step forward in creating sustainable and efficient rental solutions.
